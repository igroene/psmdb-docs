# Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.0-1 (2023-08-)

We are pleased to announce the release of the new major version of Percona Server for MongoDB 7.0.0-1 – the drop in replacement for MongoDB Community Edition. Percona Server for MongoDB supports MongoDB community protocols and drivers and enhances it with the enterprise-grade features for free, enabling you to effectively meet the requirements of your organization in terms of High-availability, reliability and data security. 

You can install Percona Server for MongoDB packages from Percona repositories or download them from the web site. To upgrade from the previous version of Percona Server for MongoDB, follow the [upgrade guide](../install/upgrade-from-60.md).

## Release Highlights

MongoDB 7.0 features and improvements are focused on the following main areas: 

### Streamlined development process

* Using the new system variable [$USER_ROLES](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/reference/aggregation-variables/#mongodb-variable-variable.USER_ROLES) you can build a single dynamic view instead of multiple static views to control access to data depending on the user’s roles and permissions.
* [Compound wildcard indexes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/core/indexes/index-types/index-wildcard/index-wildcard-compound/#std-label-wildcard-index-compound) enable you to filter documents that have common but not identical attributes. You can build a compound wildcard index on an always-present field as well as on one or more arbitrary fields thus reducing the number of indexes on a table. This also simplifies coding of your application to work with such tables.
* You can now [selectively delete one or more documents within time series collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/core/timeseries/timeseries-limitations/#deletes). Partial TTL indexes enable you to age out your data in a more controlled way.
* The new [`$percentile`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/reference/operator/aggregation/percentile/#mongodb-group-grp.-percentile), [`$median`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/reference/operator/aggregation/median/#mongodb-group-grp.-median) and bitwise aggregation operators improve processing and operation with the stats data. 

### Optimized performance

* Added support for processing large documents for event-driven solutions: you can now split the [change streams events](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/changeStreams/#std-label-changeStreams) that exceed 16MB into fragments and then put them together to process as a whole.
* New commands [`analyzeShardKey`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/reference/command/analyzeShardKey/#mongodb-dbcommand-dbcmd.analyzeShardKey) and [`configureQueryAnalyzer`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/reference/command/configureQueryAnalyzer/#mongodb-dbcommand-dbcmd.configureQueryAnalyzer) for sharded collections help you evaluate the shard key in terms of best read and write distribution.
* The [AutoMerger](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/core/automerger-concept/#std-label-automerger-concept) now merges contiguous chunks that reside on the same shard. This reduces the sharding table, avoids unnecessary chunk migrations and improves overall performance. The AutoMerger is enabled by default.
* The `findOne`, `updateOne` and `deleteOne` command behavior is now aligned for both sharded and unsharded collections. This allows you to run these commands without having to target a specific shard. This comes handy when you need to update documents on multiple shards and you don’t know exactly on what shard the data resides.

### Security

* Improve security and safety of your sensitive data with [queryable encryption](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/core/queryable-encryption/#std-label-qe-manual-feature-qe). This mechanism enables you to encrypt/decrpyt the data on the client side, store it as encrypted on the database and run queries against the encrypted data. This way your data remains encrypted and secure throughout its whole lifecycle. The community addition supports explicit encryption only.
* SSL 3.0 is the default standard ensuring you to use the latest security standards

## Packaging changes
